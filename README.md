# AccentColorizer-E11

Colorize Windows 11 File Explorer Icon Glyphs with accent color

Part of the [AccentColorizer](https://github.com/krlvm/AccentColorizer) project

The program will run in background and recolorize the glyphs every time accent color is changed, but if you need to run it once and don't want to have it running in background, launch it with `-Apply` argument:

```powershell
$ AccentColorizer-E11.exe -Apply
```

If you want to revert the changes made by this program, make sure it is not running in the background and then launch it using the `-Revert` argument:

```powershell
$ AccentColorizer-E11.exe -Revert
```
